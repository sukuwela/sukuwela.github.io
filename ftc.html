                        <h4>SUMMARY: </h4><p>Verynice, a UX design company based in LA, needed help redesigning a website for their client The Freedom to Choose Project (FTC). The Freedom to Choose Project, a non-profit organization aiming to improve the lives of previously-incarcerated individuals, wanted to redesign their website to attract volunteers and increase sponsor interest. They enlisted the help of UX designer Paul Lumsdaine, who I interned under along with a few others for this project.</p>
                        <h4>Project Duration:</h4><p>April 2018 - June 2018</p>
                        <h4>The Team: </h4>

                        <p>Verynice only wanted our help with the design aspect of the project - which meant we were minimally involved with the user research component of the project. They worked one-on-one with the Freedom to Choose Project, and relayed the client’s user needs and pain points via a sitemap. We then were instructed to create our wireframes and mockups with this information. </p>

                        <h3 class="text-center">The Skeleton: Creating the Wireframes (Design Directions)</h3>
                        <div id="ftc-wireframing" class="medium-6 large-8 large-offset-2 cell float-center">
                          <div class="responsive-embed"><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/10vUj1LyrrZBxwFgcQB5RTdpURfAAISrb/preview" frameBorder="0" width="760" height="480"></iframe></div>
                        </div>
                        <p>For our first design sprint, Paul instructed us to each create our own wireframes for the start of this project, so that we could provide the client with various options to choose from. As all of the information architecture we needed to design our wireframes came from Verynice, we initially had some difficulty accessing the documents needed (sitemap, UI kit, assets that Verynice wanted us to use). Also, with each of us creating our own style of low-fidelity wireframes for this iteration, we had to re-edit our final designs as there were some inconsistencies in formatting and fonts used. I noted that this delayed our wireframes by a couple of days - not ideal during a design sprint. We were only able to complete two-thirds of our first iteration of wireframing pages - which prompted Verynice to step in and finish the rest. In hindsight, we should have set more realistic expectations of when we would complete our tasks - taking into account the possibility of unexpected setbacks.</p> 
                        
                        <h3 class="text-center">The Surface: Creating the Mockups</h3> 
                        <div class="responsive-embed"><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wOe3oGlfPtG9___7zgiykeR5DeWf1i7R/preview" frameBorder="0" width="640" height="480"></iframe></div>
                        <p>With the wireframing iterations in motion, we began to work on the visual design of FTC. Verynice provided us with initial design directions of the website. We handed off the first iteration of the visual designs to Jacob, to ensure a consistent style for all pages. Eleanor and I focused on creating a style guide for the rough designs Jacob created, confirming the styling was both accessible and responsive. </p>
                        
                        <p>We found some color pairings within the palette to have a low contrast ratio, which prompted some trial and error on both parts to create color combinations that would meet the standard on the website. After a couple of tries, we finally settled on an accessible design palette for all components of the website.We turned in an initial rough draft of the homepage to Verynice, who provided additional feedback to address before submitting our first iteration of designs.</p>
                       
                        <p>Due to some miscommunication, we found that our first iteration of visual designs was assigned and due on the same day. However, we initially thought we would have a couple of days to complete this assignment. With the amount of components we had to work on, we found this to be an unreasonable request, but had no leeway into getting an extension. We prioritized and worked on the designs as fast as we could, and were able to turn them in a day after the deadline. With the feedback provided from Verynice and the client, we completed the final iteration of the wireframes during this phase as well, reflecting the changes we made into the final iterations of the visual designs.</p>
                        
                        <p>As we transitioned into the interaction design phase of our project, we were unexpectedly tasked with designing the wireframes for the mobile version of the website. We quickly designed wireframes for the mobile version of the website, and then proceeded to note the elements and interactions used on all pages of the website via InDesign. For this phase of the project, I highlighted the key elements in all the mockups of FTC’s website, noting the design reasoning behind each. I also noted any possible interactions that could be used, linking the UI code that could be used to accomplish such. As we were still finishing up the final iteration of the visual designs, I had to go back and update the InDesign comments I made previously as well.</p>

                    <p>After a few additional changes, Verynice submitted the final designs to our client the Freedom to Choose Project, who was very happy with the work we completed. This was Verynice’s client and project, so we did not have much say in how the UX process would be implemented, and simply followed their instructions. As such, we solely worked on the wireframing and visual design aspects of the project. It may have been possible that further UX research and testing (other than client research and testing) was conducted for this project, but we were not a part of the project at that time. </p>
                    <p>That being said, working with a real client gave me the opportunity to explore and apply various UX methods and processes, allowing me to grow and expand my knowledge as a UX designer. I focused on user-centered, responsive and accessible design throughout the wireframing and visual design phases of the project. For example, working with a difficult color palette of orange and purple tested my design accessibility skill in finding a color combination that both adhered to the client’s logo as well as created a visually engaging design. Managing deadlines is a key part of the UX process as well. I learned the importance of understanding the client’s expectations, and subsequently communicating the scope and time that it takes for various phases of the project to be complete. In future projects, I plan to apply the knowledge I learned working on the Freedom to Choose Project and continue to challenge myself as a UX designer.
