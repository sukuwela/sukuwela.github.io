		  </header>
		  <article>I am a fourth year student studying Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine currently searching for a 
			  full-time position or internship. After taking a User Interaction Software class, I realized I love UI/UX Design and 
			  am explicitly looking for a front-end or UI/UX position. I am still fairly new to the world of UX/UI, but I am eager to learn 
			  more and not only design but code these ideas into fruition. More than anything, I want to continue learning, and apply the 
		    skills I have attained throughout my career. I have a deep interest in the arts, specifically graphic design as well as 
			  cinematography, and am aiming to find new ways
		    to merge the skills I've gotten through Computer Science and apply them in creative, different ways.

			  <h3 class>NavFeel Android Application</h3>
			  <img src="img/navfeel_login_screen_redo.png" alt="NavFeel Login Screen"/>
			  <h4 class>Overview:</h3>
			  <ul>
				  <li><Strong>Summary:</Strong> Users want to better identify their emotions or combat their negative emotions and 
					   identify possible causes which may be linked to their environment 
					   (social, economic, daily challenges) or negative thought patterns. 
					   With an application which takes input from users and aggregates this data into 
					   insights for users about when and where they have felt certain ways in the past, 
					   can better prepare them for a more positive future.</li>
				  <li><Strong>Objective:</Strong> To create an Android application that takes emotion and environmental data from 
					  users to show how environment may affect usersâ€™ emotions.</li>
				  <li><Strong>Approach:</Strong> Users provide their input in the form of an emoji based selection paired with 
					  a slider bar which allows users to specify the degree/intensity to which they feel this emotion, 
					  and an optional text-based entry which can be analyzed for words correlated with each emotion and 
					  overall text sentiment. NavFeel will also capture the location, weather,
					  and time that the entry was generated.</li>
				  <li><Strong>Project Duration:</Strong> January 2018 - March 2018</li>
				  <li><Strong>Group Members:</Strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angel-azpitarte/">Angel Azpitarte, </a>
					  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinsongina/">Gina Robinson, </a>
					  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-sanchez-4776b2aa/">Ethan Sanchez</a>
				  <li><Strong>My Role:</Strong> I developed a low-fidelity prototype to track user flow, then researched common patterns in 
					  mental health applications as well as color theory to design a high-fidelity prototype
					  via Marvel.</li>
				  <li><Strong>Links:</Strong>

				  <li><Strong>Final Product:</Strong> Application still in development.</li>			   
			  </ul>
			  <!--
			  <h4 class>UX Process: </h4>
			  <p><Strong>Research: </Strong>I explored various applications that are
			  thriving in the mental health industry, as well as the use of mobile applications to monitor mental health.
			  I performed competitive analysis on three different applications: Stigma, Daylio, and T2 Mood Tracker to identify
				  how our application will stand out from the others, and appeal to our own customer base. Our team also 
				  researched the affect of mobile applications on mental health, gathering that these applications allow 
				  people to have an easier access to treatment, due to the accessibility of smart phones.

			  <h3>Speaks Web Application</h3>
			  <img src="img/speaks_login.png" alt="Speaks Login Screen"/>
			  <h4 class>Overview:</h3>
			  <ul><li><Strong>Summary:</Strong> Children with autism or other learning disabilities have difficulty understanding social 
				  queues and social situations, as well as communication. In order to improve such, our team is developing an 
				  application that teaches children about different social positions such as firefighter or mailman, so that they 
				  can better understand these scenarios as well as communicate them to others.</li>
				  <li><Strong>Objective:</Strong> To help children with learning disabilities 
					  improve their social and communication skills through an easy and accessible web application.
				  </li>
				  <li><Strong>Approach:</Strong>The children are provided with various social scenarios to choose from such as 
				  firefighter, policeman, mailman and more. After choosing a scenario, the child will answer questions that ask to match 
				  the correct tools the firefighter, policeman, etc. will need in order to perform their job. The child will be guided with 
				  helpful hints if they are incorrect to help them along.</li>
				  <li><Strong>Project Duration:</Strong> January 2018 - March 2018</li>
				  <li><Strong>My Role:</Strong> I performed qualitative interviews with teachers and aids working
					  with children with autism remotely to ensure autism-friendly design. I also tested this application along with
					 my team members, with children with autism to ensure that our design was actually accessibile and usable, as well as any changes that need to be made going 
					  forward with the application.

			  <h3 class>Othello</h3>
			  	<img src="img/othello_user_input.png" alt="Othello User Input Interface">
			  <img src="img/othello_gui_interface.png" alt="Othello GUI Interface">
			  <ul><li>Created Othello class and implemented functions to produce 
					  game logic (three separate files for user input, GUI interface, and game logic)</li>
<li>Implemented one class for each file and created 24 functions to yield game logic</li>
				  <li>Programmed a two-player, interactive strategy board game</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p><Strong>Thoughts:</Strong> When I was first assigned this project, I recall feeling extremely nervous 
				  to take it on. It was the first time I was required to code such a comprehensive project on my own, 
				 what with only a few months' prior experience under my belt. The entire process was grueling, most
				  especially the game logic. I spent hours upon hours in lab, receiving the TA's help as often as I
				  could. Through patience, perseverance, and constant trial-and-error I was finally able to make the
				  game logic work. As I said before, this was my first time coding such a large project, which explains
				  why my code isn't exactly as "up-to-standard" as it could be. Anyway, to put it simply, after I
				  realized that I had the capability to complete this kind of project on my own, I felt a little more 
				  confident (as well as more capable) in pursuing a computer science degree.

		  <article>
			  <summary>In terms of personal activities, I've got a few hobbies up my sleeve.</summary>
				  <h3>INSA</h3>
			  <p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>To keep it simple, I joined UC Irvine's INSA dance team as a freshman in February 2014,
					 with absolutely no prior dance experience. It was a struggle trying to keep up, disheartening
					  when I was always put in the back of our performances at first. However, I continued to work hard
					  and felt myself improve - juggling classes and work in between. It was a rewarding experience that learned and grew a lot from. 
				  </p>
			  <h3>Cinematography/Editing</h3>
			  <p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>I was introduced to the world of film in high school in my TV Broadcast/Journalism class. I learned the
				  art of creating, learning how to storyboard, capture the <i>right</i> shot, and continue to create
				  stories that mattered to the audience. It allowed me to see the world in a different perspective,
				  and realize that although this is an art, the main focus of my work was its content, and how the
				  visuals I provided supplemented it.
