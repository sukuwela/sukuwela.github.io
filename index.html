		  </header>
		  <article>I am a fourth year student studying Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, and am currently 
		    looking for a full-time job within that field. I'm interested in many things within Computer Science, so I am open
		    to new experiences and learning new things. More than anything, I want to continue learning, and apply the 
		    skills I have attained throughout my career. I have a deep interest in the arts, and am aiming to find new ways
		    to merge the skills I've gotten through Computer Science and apply them in creative, different ways.

			  <p><Strong>Thoughts: </Strong>Overall, going abroad for those 4 months was a life-changing experience. I was given a once-in-a-lifetime
				  opportunity to explore a different country, having a completely different lifestyle from before. I
				  learned to adapt to my surroundings, engage myself in a language I barely knew, and continue
				  to be open-minded to a culture so different from my own.</p>

		  <p>The following projects below are all school assignments throughout 
				  my college career at UCI. If you'd like to see the code, checkout my <a href="https://github.com/sukuwela/coursework-projects
					  ">GitHub</a>.</p>
		  <article>
			  <h3 class>Instant Runoff Voting Simulation</h3>
			  <ul>
				   <li>Created a user-input prompt to receive candidateâ€™s voter preferences via text file</li>
<li>Read and organized information from text file into a map through 4 functions (using array maps, array sets, priority queues)</li>
				  <li>Printed voter preferences as well as winning candidate after casted vote</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p><Strong>Thoughts: </Strong>This was a pair programming project that I worked on in my Data Structures
				  class, which I found extremely difficult and stressful to work on, even with another person. This
				  was my first class returning from being abroad, so my coding skills felt very rusty. Though challenging,
				  I definitely learned a lot through the process.</p>
				  <h3 class>Othello</h3>
			  	<img src="img/othello_user_input.png" alt="Othello User Input Interface">
			  <img src="img/othello_gui_interface.png" alt="Othello GUI Interface">
			  <ul><li>Created Othello class and implemented functions to produce 
					  game logic (three separate files for user input, GUI interface, and game logic)</li>
<li>Implemented one class for each file and created 24 functions to yield game logic</li>
				  <li>Programmed a two-player, interactive strategy board game</li>
			  </ul>
			  <p><Strong>Thoughts:</Strong> When I was first assigned this project, I recall feeling extremely nervous 
				  to take it on. It was the first time I was required to code such a comprehensive project on my own, 
				 what with only a few months' prior experience under my belt. The entire process was grueling, most
				  especially the game logic. I spent hours upon hours in lab, receiving the TA's help as often as I
				  could. Through patience, perseverance, and constant trial-and-error I was finally able to make the
				  game logic work. As I said before, this was my first time coding such a large project, which explains
				  why my code isn't exactly as "up-to-standard" as it could be. Anyway, to put it simply, after I
				  realized that I had the capability to complete this kind of project on my own, I felt a little more 
				  confident (as well as more capable) in pursuing a computer science degree.

		  <article>
			  <summary>In terms of personal activities, I've got a few hobbies up my sleeve.</summary>
				  <h3>INSA</h3>
				  <p>To keep it simple, I joined UC Irvine's INSA dance team as a freshman in February 2014,
					 with absolutely no prior dance experience. It was a struggle trying to keep up, disheartening
					  when I was always put in the back of our performances at first. However, I continued to work hard
					  and felt myself improve - juggling classes and work in between. It was a rewarding experience that learned and grew a lot from.
