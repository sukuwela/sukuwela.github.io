                        <h4>SUMMARY: </h4><p>SmartOven is a project about designing a digital oven that can track commercial bakes efficiently and easily.Bakers have difficulty ensuring commercial bakes are up to standard and efficiently made. With SmartOven, bakers have the ability to control and track all their bakes in one place. The commercial baking process is streamlined using machine learning and internet-connected sensors to gather and analyze data, visualized via dashboards. With this data, bakers can improve their baking efficiency as well as the baking process. I wanted to practice and showcase my skills in UX, and this project was a great way to do so. SmartOven is a project designed by my fellow UX Designer Eleanor Meriwether and me. Eleanor acted as the client, while I was the UX designer for her product, SmartOven. </p>

                        <p>Based on the client’s needs, I was instructed to design SmartOven, from the sketching phase to the prototyping phase. This project was designed to specifically focus on the design phase of the UX process, so UX research was not a part of this project. That being said, I noted this as an added challenge to designing this product, since I would not be able to gather real user data (other than the stakeholder’s) before tackling the design. </p>

                        <p>In this case, I was unable to conduct user interviews, and addressed the design of the application based on the stakeholder’s ideas. I conducted a whiteboarding session with the client, who listed off the various needs she wanted to satisfy in SmartOven. Since this was a practice project, Eleanor and I had some moments where we had to make up the user needs as we went along, but we gathered enough data to begin sketching.</p> 
                        <p>I set up a basic sketch of SmartOven, categorizing the information into five menu items:</p>
                        <p>1. Dashboard</p>
                        <p class="tab">a. Alerts</p>
                        <p class="doubletab">i. Examples</p>
                        <p class="tripletab">1. Time for bake</p>
                        <p class="tripletab">2. Oven malfunction</p>
                        <p class="tab">b. Temperature & Humidity Graph</p>
                        <p class="tab">c. Live Bake Feed</p>
                        <p class="doubletab">i. Managers/Administrators would have baking controls:</p>
                        <p class="tripletab">1. Temperature</p>
                        <p class="tripletab">2. Humidity</p>
                        <p class="tripletab">3. Timer</p>
                        <p>2. Bake Log</p>
                        <p class="tab">a. Bake Schedule</p>
                        <p class="tab">b. Bake History</p>
                        <p>3. Recipes</p>
                        <p class="tab">a. List of Recipes</p>
                        <p class="tab">b. Add/Edit/Delete recipes option</p>
                        <p>4. Oven Admin</p>
                        <p class="tab">a. Baking controls for manager (This section was removed during the wireframing phase, since it is found in the Live Bake Feed section)</p>
                        <p>5. User Admin</p>
                        <p class="tab">a. Edit permission/access rights per employee</p>
                        <p class="tab">b. Add/Edit/Delete employees</p>
                        <p class="tab">c. List of employees</p>
                        <p>Since employees do not have administrative rights, they would only be able to access the Dashboard, Bake Log and Recipes sections. I sketched out various ways to display the features and components, giving me enough to work with for the wireframing portion of the project.</p>
                        
                        <h3 class="text-center">The Skeleton: Creating the Wireframes</h3> 
                        <div><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vXdaHgFa0c1VQ4fiM9y29nFC0lwGhTql/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe></div>
                        <figcaption>SmartOven Wireframes</figcaption>
                        <p>After whiteboarding the basic layout and content of SmartOven, I created low-fidelity wireframes of each menu item listed above. I started out using Adobe XD’s Wires UI kit, adjusting it to improve its usability. I expanded on the content of the cards in each dashboard, specifying how the information will be displayed as well as the key details of each card. I focused mainly on the content and navigation, making sure the dashboards followed a consistent format.</p>
                        
                        <p>I found myself having issues with figuring out how to intuitively design the oven controls for adjusting the temperature, humidity and timer. I initially used arrows, but felt that didn’t make sense considering the context of the functions. I thought also about applying skeuomorphism, using dials like an actual oven, but felt that didn’t translate well to control through a desktop screen. I looked up some digital oven designs for inspiration, but found they also had fairly confusing interfaces, so I drew from the parts that worked well. I settled on using +/- buttons as I felt that in the context of using an oven, representing the oven controls as such was the most intuitive.  </p>
                        
                        <h3 class="text-center">The Surface: Creating the Mockups</h3>

                        <figcaption>SmartOven Prototype</figcaption>
                        <p>I realized a large part of the mockups phase was understanding what the personality of the product should be. I tried a few color palettes and fonts, but I got stuck and realized I had to answer a few questions first.</p>
                        <p class="tab">1. What is the feel and personality of the product, and how does that translate into the visual design?</p>
                        <p class="tab">2. Is that personality catering to the users and goal of this product?</p>
                        <img src="img\smartoven\Mockup Pattern Library.png">
                        <figcaption>SmartOven Mockup Pattern Library</figcaption>
                        <p>I realized that having a good understanding of the personality of your product correlates to how your visual design looks. After talking to the client, we concluded SmartOven should feel like a sleek product with minimal design to mirror how simple and efficient the product is. Looking back, I should have first focused on curating a design brief of what the features and personality of the product was, as well as a set of design principles to figure out what the experience of using the product should feel like to a user. </p>
                        <p>As I delved more into the final designs of the product, I found more questions cropping up:</p>
                        <p class="tab">1. How will this design help the user navigate throughout the product?</p>
                        <p class="tab">2. How do I present the edit recipe mode in a way that fits the theme of the design?</p>
                        <p>I decided to use the blue as a highlight color of the main functions per screen, with the darker blue used to differentiate from the other functions within the screen. After some inspiration, I decided to keep the edit mode simple, using dash-lines around the text data to indicate that it was editable. I also did quick research into what a typical baker’s schedule is like, in order to represent real content.</p>
                        <p>I wanted to show visual interactions in my prototype because I felt it fully embodied the user experience. The underline animation for the menu items is a subtle, but effective way to show the product’s simplicity, as well as adding a delightful experience for the user. I kept the buttons simple, as I did not want to overcrowd the product with fancy animations that would distract the user.</p>

                    <p>SmartOven was a rewarding project that challenged and improved my skills as a UX designer. Though I did not get to work with a real client nor do user research, it gave me the opportunity to implement a real UX design phase. </p>
                    <p>Implementing a thorough design phase allowed me to expand my skills not only as a UX designer, but a visual UX designer. It allowed me to understand how UX design and visual design go hand in hand. Understanding what functions the client wanted played into how the user would intuitively and visually interact with those functions. I focused on user-centered techniques like whiteboarding, wireframing, and prototyping that shaped the user’s experience, while accommodating to the client’s vision. I learned that sketching and wireframing does not only involve understanding the information architecture of your product, but also the user flows that inherently affect the interaction and visual design. Regardless, with some research-backed assumptions, I created a design that not only showed a sleek experience, but an intuitive one as well.</p>
                    <p>In hindsight, I realize this project would have been different if I had access to users. In many cases, I was forced to make assumptions on what the user would want and need based on current UX standards and my own online research. If I had worked with a real client, I understand that this process may not have run as smoothly, as there would have been the possibility of client changes mid-way through the process. In the future, I hope to have the chance to take the skills I’ve learned in this project to a real client, as well as advocate for more opportunities to implement UX methods throughout the process.</p>
