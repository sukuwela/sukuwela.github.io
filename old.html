		  <article>I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Irvine with a B.S. in Computer Science and a specialization
              in Information. After taking a User Interaction Software class this past year, I found my passion for User Experience design
              and realized it was the career that I wanted to pursue wholeheartedly. Due to previous experience in cinematography, I find UX Design very similar, as it is not just about developing a great experience for the user, but telling a story through it as well. Cinematography is very much the same, as we create not for ourselves, but for what our specific audience wants, which changes depending on the kind of content we went to create. Not only do I have this design-oriented mind, but with my experience in programming, I can also bring these experiences to life.

			  <h3>NavFeel Android Application</h3>
			  <img src="img/navfeel/navfeel_login_screen_redo.png" alt="NavFeel Login Screen"/>
			  <h4 class>Overview:</h4>
			  <ul>
				  <li><Strong>Summary:</Strong> Users want to better identify their emotions or combat their negative emotions and 
					   identify possible causes which may be linked to their environment 
					   (social, economic, daily challenges) or negative thought patterns. 
					   With an application which takes input from users and aggregates this data into 
					   insights for users about when and where they have felt certain ways in the past, 
					   can better prepare them for a more positive future.</li>
				  <li><Strong>Objective:</Strong> To create an Android application that takes emotion and environmental data from 
					  users to show how environment may affect usersâ€™ emotions.</li>
				  <li><Strong>Approach:</Strong> Users provide their input in the form of an emoji based selection paired with 
					  a slider bar which allows users to specify the degree/intensity to which they feel this emotion, 
					  and an optional text-based entry which can be analyzed for words correlated with each emotion and 
					  overall text sentiment. NavFeel will also capture the location, weather,
					  and time that the entry was generated.</li>
				  <li><Strong>Project Duration:</Strong> January 2018 - March 2018</li>
				  <li><Strong>Group Members:</Strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angel-azpitarte/">Angel Azpitarte, </a>

					  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-sanchez-4776b2aa/">Ethan Sanchez</a>
				  <li><Strong>My Role:</Strong> I developed a low-fidelity prototype to track user flow, then researched common patterns in 
					  mental health applications as well as color theory to design a high-fidelity prototype
					  via Marvel.</li>
				  <li><Strong>Links:</Strong>

			  <h4 class>UX Process: </h4>
			  <p><Strong>Research: </Strong>I explored various applications that are thriving in the mental health industry, as well as the use of mobile applications to monitor mental health.I performed <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XCwjqHFQwZ_pUpoP4SCBlk-zpXc_Z4M7hhBE_XzVkV4/edit?usp=sharing"> competitive analysis</a> on three different applications: Stigma, Daylio, and T2 Mood Tracker to identify how our application will stand out from the others, and appeal to our own customer base. Our team also researched the affect of mobile applications on mental health, gathering that these applications allow people to have an easier access to treatment, due to the accessibility of smart phones. After conducting research, we were better able to design our application so that it would follow "recognition rather than recall" standard. 
			  </p>
              <p><Strong>Wireframing: </Strong>Our <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sukuwela/sukuwela.github.io/master/img/navfeel_low_fidelity.jpg">initial design of the application</a> focused on how the user would make their "emotion entries", how they would access old entries, as well as how to look at recommendations based off of their previous entries. We initially thought the homepage of the application would be the calendar, with an option to add a new entry for the current day. </p>

              <summary>In terms of personal activities, I've got a few hobbies up my sleeve.</summary>
              <h3>INSA</h3>
              <p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>To keep it simple, I joined UC Irvine's INSA dance team as a freshman in February 2014, with absolutely no prior dance experience. It was a struggle trying to keep up, disheartening when I was always put in the back of our performances at first. However, I continued to work hard and felt myself improve - juggling classes and work in between. It was a rewarding experience that learned and grew a lot from.</p>
			  <h3>Cinematography/Editing</h3>
              <p><strong>Thoughts: </strong>I was introduced to the world of film in high school in my TV Broadcast/Journalism class. I learned the art of creating, learning how to storyboard, capture the <i>right</i> shot, and continue to create stories that mattered to the audience. It allowed me to see the world in a different perspective, and realize that although this is an art, the main focus of my work was its content, and how the visuals I provided supplemented it.</p>
