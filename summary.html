			  <p>User interviews are necessary in order to get an idea of what sort of audience you are trying to attract
			  before creating your project. For my portfolio website, I am trying to use it as a "fancy" resume, highlighting
			  my skills as well as my personality. In order to make sure that the content I provided would actually be what 
			  employers would want, I interviewed Professor Lumsdaine since I am interested in UX design. I wanted to know 
			  what I should focus on if I wanted to pursue a career in that field. I also interviewed classmates that would 
			  have a similar idea of what I should provide if I wanted to enter a career in Computer Science. Lastly, I also 
			  interviewed people unfamiliar with computer science, in case there would be, for example, a CEO unfamiliar with 
				  Computer Science that was in search for a freelance designer or programmer.</p>

			  <p>A competitor analysis is where you research other products that are trying to achieve the same
				  goal as you with their services. In my case, I was trying to compare how I would fare against other
				  "portfolio style" websites. So, I did a competitor analysis on three different websites: About.me, 
				  LinkedIn, and PortfolioBox - websites whose main goal is to help users attain a job. I analyzed these 
			  websites in particular because each had their own unique strong points: LinkedIn was heavily career-focused, 
			  About.me focused on simple content, and PortfolioBox focused on creativity and visual design. By analyzing 
			  these three sites, I was able to see how these features benefitted as well as hindered their goal.</p>

			  <p>Feature Value Matrices help to understand and define what are the key parts of your project. By doing a 
			  feature value matrix, I was able to pin-point the features that I absolutely needed for my website so that
			  it would not only work well, but one would receive the content they wanted to see. I defined the features I needed
			were a profile photo and my name, an about section, professional skills section, navigation, personal section
				  and design elements.</p>

			  <p>Feature Prioritization allows one to visualize your Feature Value Matrix so that you can further
			  understand what features are most important for your product. By using the feature prioritization and kano model,
			  it allowed me to really think about what was most important for my website. The feature value matrix rated 
			  what features are most beneficial, but the visual aspect of the feature prioritization allowed me to further
			  narrow down what features I absolutely needed for my website. As such, I realized that
			  I needed to focus on navigation and make sure my content was easily accessible and readable.</p>

				  ">View User Stories</a></ul>
			  <p>User Stories give you a deeper understanding of what kind of users you are expecting to use your product.
			  In my case, my website is a portfolio, so I assumed, for the most part, what a hiring manager would want or
			  expect from my website. I drew from my feature value matrix and created stories based off of those features, 
			  elaborating when necessary, and allowing me to further understand what a hiring manager wanted out of each
			  feature, and how important it was to them. I also focused on making stories for my competitors, and tried to analyze
			  what they would find from the various features of my website.</p>
