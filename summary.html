			  User interviews are necessary in order to get an idea of what sort of audience you are trying to attract
			  before creating your project. For my portfolio website, I am trying to use it as a "fancy" resume, highlighting
			  my skills as well as my personality. In order to make sure that the content I provided would actually be what 
			  employers would want, I interviewed Professor Lumsdaine since I am interested in UX design. I wanted to know 
			  what I should focus on if I wanted to pursue a career in that field. I also interviewed classmates that would 
			  have a similar idea of what I should provide if I wanted to enter a career in Computer Science. Lastly, I also 
			  interviewed people unfamiliar with computer science, in case there would be, for example, a CEO unfamiliar with 
			  Computer Science that was in search for a freelance designer or programmer.
