			  <p>User interviews are necessary in order to get an idea of what sort of audience you are trying to attract
			  before creating your project. For my portfolio website, I am trying to use it as a "fancy" resume, highlighting
			  my skills as well as my personality. In order to make sure that the content I provided would actually be what 
			  employers would want, I interviewed Professor Lumsdaine since I am interested in UX design. I wanted to know 
			  what I should focus on if I wanted to pursue a career in that field. I also interviewed classmates that would 
			  have a similar idea of what I should provide if I wanted to enter a career in Computer Science. Lastly, I also 
			  interviewed people unfamiliar with computer science, in case there would be, for example, a CEO unfamiliar with 
				  Computer Science that was in search for a freelance designer or programmer.</p>

			  <p>A competitor analysis is where you research other products that are trying to achieve the same
				  goal as you with their services. In my case, I was trying to compare how I would fare against other
				  "portfolio style" websites. So, I did a competitor analysis on three different websites: About.me, 
				  LinkedIn, and PortfolioBox - websites whose main goal is to help users attain a job. I analyzed these 
			  websites in particular because each had their own unique strong points: LinkedIn was heavily career-focused, 
			  About.me focused on simple content, and PortfolioBox focused on creativity and visual design. By analyzing 
			  these three sites, I was able to see how these features benefitted as well as hindered their goal.</p>

			  <p>Feature Value Matrices help to understand and define what are the key parts of your project. By doing a 
			  feature value matrix, I was able to pin-point the features that I absolutely needed for my website so that
			  it would not only work well, but one would receive the content they wanted to see. I defined the features I needed
			were a profile photo and my name, an about section, professional skills section, navigation, personal section
				  and design elements.</p>

				  ">View Feature Prioritization</a></ul>
			  <p>Feature Prioritization allows one to visualize your Feature Value Matrix so that you can further
			  understand what features are most important for your product. By using the feature prioritization and kano model,
			  it allowed me to really think about what was most important for my website. The feature value matrix rated 
			  what features are most beneficial, but the visual aspect of the feature prioritization allowed me to further
			  narrow down what features I absolutely needed for my website. As such, I realized that
			  I needed to focus on navigation and make sure my content was easily accessible and readable.</p>

				  ">View User Stories</a></ul>
			  <p>User Stories give you a deeper understanding of what kind of users you are expecting to use your product.
			  In my case, my website is a portfolio, so I assumed, for the most part, what a hiring manager would want or
			  expect from my website. I drew from my feature value matrix and created stories based off of those features, 
			  elaborating when necessary, and allowing me to further understand what a hiring manager wanted out of each
			  feature, and how important it was to them. I also focused on making stories for my competitors, and tried to analyze
			  what they would find from the various features of my website.</p>

				  ">View Cognitive Walkthrough</a></ul>
			  <p>Cognitive Walkthroughs allow you to observe how your user would navigate your website, so that you 
			  can understand what features are actually beneficial to your site, and vice versa. I attempted three
			  different cognitive walkthroughs, and focused on asking questions that about my site that I had a 
			  feeling were not as up-to-par as it should be. I asked them to find specific content on my site, and was
			  able to see that the navigation bar titles could be misleading. I also asked about the overall design, as well as
			  content of the site, to see what parts they liked and what parts seemed to bother them. I was able
			  to see that I needed to make some changes in my navigation, as well as layout of my website. Most importantly,
			  doing a cognitive walkthrough allowed me to really understand the user's thought process, because I could
			  directly ask them what they would find confusing or difficult throughout the walkthrough.</p>

				  ">View User Test 2</a></ul>
			  <p>User testing allows you to test specific parts of your product so that you can improve on it if any problems
			  seem to occur. I find that for my website, user testing is effective in getting quantitative results on specific
			  details of your website. I used Usability Hub to create two User tests, one to analyze the navigation to 
			  a specific piece of content on my site, and another to analyze the overall "look" of my site. I found that I was
			  able to see what the majority of people attempted to do on my site, and realized how much these specific features
			  were causing problems for my site. For example, I found that many people could not pin-point where to find my
			  skills, and people found the "fun stuff" section difficult to understand.</p>

			  <h2 class="text-center">Summary of Findings</h2>
		  </header>
		  <article><p>Overall, researching and testing really helped me understand how to create my website. What I found most helpful
			  was the user research. This is my first attempt at building a website, so I had no idea what exactly I was trying 
			  to accomplish. Researching and, most especially, figuring out the key features of my website really helped me 
			  begin the coding process. If I had simply jumped straight in to coding the website, the end result would have
			  been a mess. Through this research, I realized that the most important part of my website was the content, and 
			  following that, being able to <i>easily</i> access my content. As such, I didn't pay much attention to the overall
			  design of my website, and went for a very clean, <i>very</i> minimal look. Though it wasn't my intention
			  to create a very Tumblr-esque, "blog"-looking website, but this was my first time building a website. All I knew was
			  that you should be able to access and see my content. By doing so, I realized how important of a role spacing and font played in the design of my website.
			  You don't have to add bunch of colors and fancy animations to make something visually pleasing. With almost little-
			  to-no CSS, a website can still be pretty.</p>
			  <p>Delving into the user testing part of the project allowed me to really see the results of my work. By 
				implementing cognitive walkthroughs, I was able to get inside the mind of a typical user, and observe
				  how they would use my website. I hadn't realized how confusing it was to find the "skills" section
				  of my website. After going through cognitive walkthroughs as well user testing, many people seemed
				  to just have educated guesses as to where it could be. I realized that having tabs like "about", 
				  "education", and "projects" made it difficult to pin-point where you'd learn about my personal skills.
				  Another thing I noticed was that people weren't exactly sure what my website was for. The fact that 
				  when you initially open up my website, and all you see is my face and name, was not enough to really
				  understand what the point of this site was, or rather, make people continue to use it. Some people 
				  mentioned that the website didn't really appear to be like a portfolio website for a computer programmer, 
				  but rather a designer, which I found surprising to hear.</p>
			  <p>In summary, gathering all of this information has helped not only create a website but also given me a 
				  clear idea of what needs to be improved on.</p>

			  <h2 class="text-center">Incorporation of Findings</h2>
		  </header>
		  <article><p>After conducting all of these user interviews and tests, I realize that I will need to make some 
			  minor adjustments to the navigation, design and even content of my website. First off, I think a very key part of my website is 
			  being able to find my skills. I feel like many employers would look to find your skills first more than anything, so that 
			  they can confirm that you are capable for the job. However, since many people had trouble finding where my skills would be, I 
			  think I will include a tab, or even add to the title of one of my sections to make it more clear. Instead of having an 
			  education tab, I will rewrite it and have an "Educations and Skills" tab. In my head, I feel that the skills should be paired 
			  with my education, because that is where I have learned the bulk of my programming languages. In terms of design, I think 
			  I will alter my website so that when you first open it, you are able to see the about section, or just a simple sentence 
			  describing who I am and what I do. I think I will write down my occupation below my name, so that people will understand 
			  who I am and what I do. Lastly, I think I will alter the about section of my site, since people found that it was 
			  vague and didn't really encompass what exactly my goal was with this website.</p>
			  <p>To be honest, due to the fact that my website's design is so minimal, making these changes was actually quite 
			  simple. Incorporating these changes took little to no time at all, but has allowed my website to be a little 
			  bit more user-friendly. However, I feel that another reason improving my website was simple was because I 
			  did the user research in order to understand what my website would be. I was able to prevent problems that 
			  would have arose if I did not research. It's possible that my layout would have been un-usable, and the content 
			  that my users wanted would not be there. Also, I realize that due to the fact that my website is completely 
			  navigational via scrolling, it made it a lot easier for the user to find things as well - you didn't have to click 
			  random buttons to find the information you wanted. However, though my website has been improved, I still have personal 
			  improvements I would like to do.</p>
			  <p>All in all, incorporating these user issues was a seamless process, but personally, I would like to put a bit more effort 
				  into the design of my website, since that was never my main focus throughout its creation. Now that the content has been 
				  established, I feel that I can now play around with the "look" of my website, and try and attempt a more colorful, less 
				  minimal sort of style in the future.</p>
